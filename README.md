Welcome to my final project for the course "Construction and Development of User Interfaces." This project is a web-based implementation inspired by the game "PREGUNTADOS".

To run the project, make sure you have a valid version of Node.js installed, or use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js versions. For this project I worked with:

*Node v20.12.2*

*NVM v1.1.12*

But it would run with Node v16.x or higher

```
npm install 
```

```
npm run dev
```
